	This project is a guitar hero game that demonstrates ROM sprites and timers that can detect input. The latter
component is incomplete, but functions slightly. To use this project, compile the hardware and program it to the FPGA
board. Make sure a VGA monitor is connected to the port on the board. Next, open Eclipse to generate the BSP for the GuitarHero project, build the project, and run it. You will see 
some lines written to the screen and then they will be cleared. Then, the random sentences screensaver from lab 7
will begin. Notice the transparent background that allows one to see the sprites moving from top to bottom and the
background. Pressing KEY1 will manipulate the LEDs. The rightmost are meant to represent missing the sprites, and the 
leftmost are meant to represent hitting the sprites. This rarely works.
