ABOUT THIS TEMP PROJECT

This project is meant for testing hardware files separately from a given project, hopefully before they are implemented in said project.

This is so the file can be made top-level and analyzed separately- with design statistics, RTL viewer, and Modelsim. It will also make compilation faster.

Don't forget to change the top-level to the thing you're trying to test.
